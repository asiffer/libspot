## Getting libspot

### Git
The code is available on github. You can either clone the repository

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/asiffer/libspot.git
```
or download the last version archive <a href="https://github.com/asiffer/libspot/archive/master.zip">here</a>.


### Ubuntu
For Ubuntu users, the following personal package archive (ppa) can be added to you system:

```shell
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:asiffer/libspot
$ sudo apt-get update
```

Then you can easily install the `libspot` package (and the `libspot-dev` package if you want the headers):

```shell
$ sudo apt install libspot libspot-dev 
```

### Debian-like distributions
As the packaging is made on launchpad, they are specific to Ubuntu. However, the .deb files can easily be added to other debian-like systems.
In `/etc/apt/sources.list`:
```ini
...
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/asiffer/libspot/ubuntu bionic main
```
Then you can add the public key to your system and download the package:
```shell
$ curl https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup\?op\=get\&search\=0x76F580E5B58944D9 | sudo apt-key add -
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install libspot libspot-dev 
```

### Linux (Snap)

I have recently discovered [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/) which claims to be a *universal app store for linux*. You only need to install `snap` on your linux system and then:

```shell
sudo snap install libspot
```

I also give you the fancy button:

</a>



## Python

The `python3` bindings are also available on <a href="https://github.com/asiffer/python3-libspot">github</a> or through the same ppa:

```shell
$ sudo apt install python3-libspot
```

You can also download these bindings through the `pip` package manager
```shell
$ pip3 install pylibspot
```
<div class="alert">
Unlike `apt`Â which checks the dependencies, you need to previously install the `libspot` library if you download the bindings through `pip`.
</div>

## Golang

`libspot` has also been re-implemented in `Go`. You can get it through:
```shell
$ go get github.com/asiffer/gospot
```

**libspot** is a C++ library for anomaly detection in streaming data.

The library uses **Extreme Value Theory** to perform probabilistic thresholding and 
is able to process **more one million data a second** on the average man's laptop.

More precisely, `libspot` implements the [SPOT algorithm](about/). You can interact 
with the library either directly of through python bindings. Finally, a pure Go implementation
also exist. As an example, the latter powers the 
[Netspot Intrusion Detection System](https://asiffer.github.io/netspot/).
